# Champions of Regnum Macros

This is a repository to hold Champions of Regnum Macros in autohotkey.

This is a Champions of Regnum script that is able to switch the macros being used using ImageSearch to identify the current character class being used.

A small GUI displays the current class and the current jewelry setting.

The script uses the ```MultiConfig.ahk``` file and different files for each subclass to enable easier customizable extensions.

### Image File Type

The recommended image file type to use is **.bmp**.

---

### How to Run

To run the script simply execute the ```MultiConfig.ahk``` depending on the class Realm (Alsius, Ignis, Syrtis).

Afterwards, clicking ```F9``` will update the current class being used which can be seen on the GUI.
