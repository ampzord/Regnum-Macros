# Champions of Regnum Macros

This is a repository to hold Champions of Regnum Macros in autohotkey.

This is a Champions of Regnum script that is able to switch the macros being used using ImageSearch to identify the current character class being used.

A small GUI displays the current class and the current jewelry setting.
